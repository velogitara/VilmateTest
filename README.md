##Introduction

This project is a demonstration of a simple interactive web page that allows you to manipulate and animate div elements using the GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) library. It showcases various animations such as moving divs to the top of the container, changing their background colors, scaling, and rotation effects.

##Features

Click on a div to move it to the top of the container with a smooth animation.
Click on the same div again to return it to its original position with a reverse animation.
Div's are animated with changing background colors, scaling, and rotation effects for a visually appealing experience.

##Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Open the index.html file in a web browser.

##Usage
Once the web page is loaded, you will see a grid of div elements displayed on a light gray background.

Click on any div element, and it will smoothly move to the top of the container with a color change, scaling, and rotation animation.

Click on the same div again, and it will return to its original position with a reverse animation.

The animations provide a visually appealing effect as the div's move and transform.

You can click on multiple di'vs in any order to create dynamic animations.
